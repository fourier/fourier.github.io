# Small usability updates to GNU APL Emacs mode

3. [Access to build-in help from Emacs](#help)

## Introduction<a name="intro">
In this blog post I'll explain some recent changes I've submitted to GNU APL and GNU APL Emacs mode.

[APL programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) is the language I'm really fascinated by. I've mainly used 2 different implementations: an excellent  implementation (including IDE) from [Dyalog](https://www.dyalog.com/) and the Free Software [GNU APL](https://www.gnu.org/software/apl/), a quality APL2 interpreter implemented by Dr. Jürgen Sauermann.

I've already submitted a couple of changes to GNU APL some time ago, mainly these:
- [patch](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-apl/2017-02/msg00209.html) to be able to compile on Sharp Zaurus,
- [additional API](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-apl/2017-02/msg00161.html) to be able to change current directory,
- [update](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-apl/2017-02/msg00167.html) to be able to use lambdas in user-defined commands
- [documentation update](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-apl/2017-04/msg00009.html) converted documentation from the [GNU APL Emacs mode](https://github.com/lokedhs/gnu-apl-mode)(by Elias Mårtenson) to the format which could be used by the GNU APL.

The last patch came from the discussion that documentation on symbols could be a part of GNU APL interpreter itself rather than Emacs mode for it.


## Compiling GNU APL on OSX 10.6<a name="osx">
Recently I've revived my old MacBook late 2006. Since the last OSX available for it is 10.6.8, not a lot of modern software could be installed on it. Hopefully for free and open source software it is at least a chance to compile it on your own.

One of the tools I'm missing on this laptop is Dyalog APL interpreter. It installs but crashes on startup.

Still it is possible to install the GNU APL interpreter on this machine. It is not available in Macports but one can easily checkout the bleeding edge version from the SVN repository:
```
svn co http://svn.savannah.gnu.org/svn/apl/trunk gnu-apl
```

In order to compile I had to modify 2 files since the function **strndup** is not available on this version of OSX 10.6:

## Access to build-in help from Emacs<a name="help">
The idea to move the documentation on symbols from Emacs to GNU APL was implemented only partly. The lacking part was a way to get this documentation back to the Emacs mode from GNU APL. These job requires 2 parts: the native part (on GNU APL side) and elisp side (on Emacs). The native part was to implement a "help" remote command which will return all the documentation (or only information on requested symbol), as it can be seen [here](https://github.com/lokedhs/gnu-apl-mode/pull/30/files).

Since the data flow is from C to Lisp, the natural choice of a data format was [S-expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression), where the list looks like ```(a b c)```, so the data protocol is basically a list of lists containing all the data.

The only "complication" was to prepare a string for sending - surround by quotes, escape quotes and slashes and convert newlines, see the **prepare_string** function.

On elisp side parsing is rather trivial. As it can be seen in function [gnu-apl--load-help](https://github.com/lokedhs/gnu-apl-mode/pull/26/files#diff-6e0b72fab51043016ef431905a7bc353R465) the main work is done by elisp reader via ```read-from-string``` which naturally parses the S-expressions from the string.
